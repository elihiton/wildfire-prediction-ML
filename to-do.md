1. make file with figures and plots
2. use weighted f-score
3. finish random trees, not really fair to compare to single nearest neighbor, probably compare to k folds
4. make another dataset with more balanced classes, refer to original paper
5. write up analysis and discussion of results
6. do k-folds for each of the datasets
