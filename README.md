I am choosing to use the generalized $f_{\Beta}$ metric with $\Beta=2$ to weight recall more heavily. This places more emphasis on the model's ability to correctly identify a "fire" instance as a fire. I'm assuming that the cost of verifying a wildfire's presence is much lower than the cost of a wildfire being missed or ignored by a deployed model.
